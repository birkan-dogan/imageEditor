In this project, I have worked with DOM manipulation and built-in functions in JavaScript âœ”.  
Using JavaScript to change the filters, rotates and flips of the images was really fun and also instructive ðŸ–¼.  
I like to use HTML Canvas to draw an image on a canvas âœ¨.  
Also, using pure-css takes the project to the next level ðŸš€.
